## Overview

The Job Scraper Platform connects students looking for opportunities with hiring managers looking to fill them. Students can browse jobs from both internal postings and external sources (RemoteOK), apply directly through the platform, and use a built-in ATS Resume Scanner to check how well their resume matches a job description. Hiring managers can post jobs, add screening questions, and review applicants along with their resumes and answers.
